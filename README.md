# Correlation Calculations Between Trends in Washington D.C.

Using three APIs (MetaWeather, District of Columbia Open Data, and Covid-19), we took api data focused in Washington D.C. to produce calculations regarding the  growth of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the correlation between daily crime and daily average weather. We created four graphs that allowed us to explore different features of matplotlib and observe patterns within data sets as well as in relation to one another. We also accessed an additional API (Food Recalls by the FDA) and created a graph displaying that data as well.
